Instructions for creating models based on xml

You need to use the xsd.exe tool which gets installed with the Windows SDK into a directory something similar to:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\bin
And on 64bit computers:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\bin
On the first run, you use xsd.exe and you convert your sample XML into a XSD file (XML schema file):

copy that file to another location (root of XMLParse app) and open a command prompt in that directory

xsd yourfile.xml
This gives you yourfile.xsd, which in a second step, you can convert again using xsd.exe into a C# class:

xsd yourfile.xsd /c
This should give you a file yourfile.cs which will contain a C# class that you can use to deserialize the XML file you're getting:

use FromXml method in encyclopedia.cs class 

Then, wrap everything but the using statement at the top in the namespace ArcReactor.Models.<type>

The full name for the object becomes ArcReactor.Models.<type>.compendium
(COULD potentially be something other than compendium but haven't seen it)
